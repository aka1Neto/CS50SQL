# From the Deep

In this problem, you'll write freeform responses to the questions provided in the specification.

## Random Partitioning

Allows for quick and simple division of data.
Since the partitioning is random, the resulting splits may vary each time, making it not reproducible.

## Partitioning by Hour

Allows better organization and optmization when looking for a specific period.
May have a bad data distribution and can lead to some server overload.

## Partitioning by Hash Value

Can evenly distribute the data but not as simple as ramdon partioning.
Good looking for specific values but not for fiding patterns.
